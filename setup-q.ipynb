    "## Understanding Q CLI Rules and Spec-Driven Development\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Q CLI Rules?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q CLI Rules** are markdown files that define project-specific guidelines, coding standards, and behavioral rules for Amazon Q Developer CLI. These rules are automatically integrated into agent contexts, ensuring consistent behavior across your development workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- **Workspace-specific**: Rules only apply to the current project directory\n",
    "- **Automatic integration**: Default agent includes all rules from `.amazonq/rules/**/*.md`\n",
    "- **Context loading**: Rules become part of the agent's context, influencing all interactions\n",
    "- **Markdown format**: Standard markdown files with headers, code blocks, and examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference:** [AWS Documentation - Project Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/command-line-project-rules.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Rules Work\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Storage**: Rules are stored in `.amazonq/rules/` directory as `.md` files\n",
    "2. **Loading**: Q CLI automatically loads all rules when starting an agent session\n",
    "3. **Context**: Rules become part of the agent's system context\n",
    "4. **Influence**: Every code generation and suggestion follows the defined rules\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule Types\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coding Standards:**\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "# Python Coding Standards\n",
    "- Use Black for code formatting\n",
    "- Maximum line length: 88 characters\n",
    "- Use type hints for all functions\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture Guidelines:**\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "# Architecture Guidelines\n",
    "- Use microservices pattern for new features\n",
    "- Implement circuit breaker for external APIs\n",
    "- All services must expose health endpoints\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Policies:**\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "# Security Guidelines\n",
    "- All API endpoints require authentication\n",
    "- Never log sensitive information\n",
    "- Use parameterized queries\n",

    "2. **Quality**: Built-in best practices and standards\n",
    "3. **Efficiency**: Reduced decision-making overhead\n",
    "4. **Maintainability**: Predictable code structure and patterns\n",
