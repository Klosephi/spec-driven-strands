    "## Understanding Q CLI Rules and Spec-Driven Development\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Q CLI Rules?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q CLI Rules** are markdown files that define project-specific guidelines, coding standards, and behavioral rules for Amazon Q Developer CLI. These rules are automatically integrated into agent contexts, ensuring consistent behavior across your development workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- **Workspace-specific**: Rules only apply to the current project directory\n",
    "- **Automatic integration**: Default agent includes all rules from `.amazonq/rules/**/*.md`\n",
    "- **Context loading**: Rules become part of the agent's context, influencing all interactions\n",
    "- **Markdown format**: Standard markdown files with headers, code blocks, and examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference:** [AWS Documentation - Project Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/command-line-project-rules.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Rules Work\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Storage**: Rules are stored in `.amazonq/rules/` directory as `.md` files\n",
    "2. **Loading**: Q CLI automatically loads all rules when starting an agent session\n",
    "3. **Context**: Rules become part of the agent's system context\n",
    "4. **Influence**: Every code generation and suggestion follows the defined rules\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule Types\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coding Standards:**\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "# Python Coding Standards\n",
    "- Use Black for code formatting\n",
    "- Maximum line length: 88 characters\n",
    "- Use type hints for all functions\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture Guidelines:**\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "# Architecture Guidelines\n",
    "- Use microservices pattern for new features\n",
    "- Implement circuit breaker for external APIs\n",
    "- All services must expose health endpoints\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Policies:**\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "# Security Guidelines\n",
    "- All API endpoints require authentication\n",
    "- Never log sensitive information\n",
    "- Use parameterized queries\n",
    "```\n",
    "### What is Spec-Driven Development?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spec-Driven Development** is a methodology where development is guided by explicit specifications and rules that define:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Project Structure**: Standardized directory layouts and file organization\n",
    "- **Development Workflow**: Step-by-step processes for building features\n",
    "- **Code Generation**: Constraints and patterns for consistent code output\n",
    "- **Testing Requirements**: Mandatory testing practices and coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Spec-Driven Development\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Consistency**: All team members follow the same patterns\n",
    "2. **Quality**: Built-in best practices and standards\n",
    "3. **Efficiency**: Reduced decision-making overhead\n",
    "4. **Maintainability**: Predictable code structure and patterns\n",
    "5. **Onboarding**: New developers can quickly understand project conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works with Strands SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules file we downloaded defines specific patterns for **AWS Strands Agent development**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Structure:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "project/\n",
    "├── infra/           # Jupyter notebooks for AWS infrastructure\n",

    "└── tests/           # Unit and integration tests\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Development Workflow:**\n",
    "1. **Research Phase**: Check PyPI for latest Strands SDK, validate existing tools\n",
    "2. **Incremental Development**: Small, testable chunks with simple implementations\n",
    "3. **Code Generation**: Precise scope, no assumptions about unstated requirements"

    "\n",
    "### How Q CLI Works\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q CLI** is an interactive AI assistant that:\n",
    "- Automatically loads your project rules from `.amazonq/rules/`\n",
    "- Uses MCP servers to access documentation and tools\n",
    "- Provides context-aware code generation and guidance\n",
    "- Can execute commands and create files in your project\n",
    "\n",
    "### Starting Q CLI\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open terminal** in your project directory\n",
    "2. **Run:** `q chat`\n",
    "3. **Wait** for Q CLI to load rules and MCP servers\n",
    "4. **Start chatting** with natural language prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool Trust and Permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "When Q CLI wants to use tools (create files, run commands), it will:\n",
    "- **Ask for permission** before executing actions\n",
    "- **Show you** exactly what it plans to do\n",
    "- **Wait for approval** before proceeding\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common responses:**\n",
    "- Type `y` or `yes` to approve\n",
    "- Type `n` or `no` to decline\n",
    "- Type `always` to auto-approve similar actions\n",
    "- Type `never` to block similar actions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "- **Review** what Q CLI plans to do before approving\n",
    "- **Start small** with simple requests to build trust\n",
    "- **Be specific** in your prompts for better results\n",
    "- **Use incremental** development approach"
